## Bootstrapping
This project uses monorepo architecture. To add/remove dependencies, you must manually enter/remove them inside package.json of respective packages then run ```npm run bootstrap``` in the root folder.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| ```npm run bootstrap``` | This will install dependencies of each package; however, it does not remove existing dependencies. |
| ```npm run rebootstrap``` | This will clean up ```node_modules``` of each package and install their dependencies. |
